      <p class="lead">My time at xor was very fun and a great learning experience. The people there where funny and smart. At the beginning it was a little awkward but other than that it was fine. The things we learned where very good tip for pitching a pitch.

  At xor we learned how to start up a company and what xor dose which is data exchange. Why it is important to know how to start up a company is because in the future you might want to start up you own company you will need to know how and even if your not starting up a company knowing how to pitch a idea is great. Also its important to know what the company dose to help you understand what there talking about.

  I think that this trip was helpful because now I know how to pitch a idea with great skill. This is something I would do again it was fun and a great learning experience which I recommend to others to learn what we learned there. My favorite part was the shark tank game that was a lot of fun.

  The worst part was nothing it was all good and fun. I would say that there where no terrible parts but there where some ify spots. Examples of those ify spots at the beginning and during the bird game it was a little awkward. It was also awkward when you talked about my youtube vids.

   In conclusion the tip was great. Learned a lot and it was a lot of fun. The most important thing I learned was how to pitch a idea. There where not terrible spots and it was all great. This was my 2 favorite field trip because it was great. .</p>
